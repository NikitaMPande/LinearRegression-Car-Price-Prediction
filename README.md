Project: Building a Student Intervention System
Install
This project requires Python 2.7 and the following Python libraries installed:

NumPy
Pandas
scikit-learn
You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer.

Code
Template code is provided in the student_intervention.ipynb notebook file. You will also be required to use the student-data.csv dataset file to complete your work. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project.

Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory student_intervention/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

ipython notebook student_intervention.ipynb
or

jupyter notebook student_intervention.ipynb
This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

Data
The dataset used in this project is included as Car Car Price Prediction.xlsx. This dataset has the following attributes:

Price_in_thousand: continuous Numbers of price
Engine_size	: Size of engine of car in continuous Numbers
Horsepower: continuous from 48 to 288
Wheelbase :continuous from 86.6 120.9.
Width	:continuous from 60.3 to 72.3.
Length: continuous from 141.1 to 208.1.
Curb_weight	:continuous from 1488 to 4066.
Fuel_capacity	:continuous from 10 t0 50
Fuel_efficiency	:continuous from 10 t0 50
Resale:continuous Numbers of price
